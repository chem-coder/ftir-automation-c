# FTIR Macro Scripts

These macros were written for use within the FTIR software to automate experimental workflows such as sample scanning, temperature ramping, and spectral post-processing.

- `SAMCOL_2.mac` – Main macro for VT-DRIFTS data collection
- `NPROC2-1.mac` – Post-processing macro for sample spectra
